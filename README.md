# stats
Personal project to develop my own statistical models and hypothesis testing functions
Please note documentation stating which functions are currently functional.
At the moment, only Fischer's Exact test has an error when summing all combinations of hypergeometric function
Multivariate regression class is nowhere near completion.  Still requires first proof of Least Square Estimator (matrix calculations/LA)
Single regression jumps passed proof of LSE as it is always zero.
